git init   ---> enable git folder in which you can add project.
create file with python.script code.
git remote add origin  https://
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sama0011/new_repository.git

"push" is the commnad  -->   puth files from local repository to Remote repository"

push orgin -u master  
 above command push the files into the remote repository.

push origin -u "branch name"  ---> in this context branch name can be one repository.
===================================================
Clone remote repository  to local  floder and make code changes and perform below steps.

mkdir git clone https://github.com/Sama0011/new_repository.git
cd clone_repo_sada_test
project copied into the folder  called  clone_repo_sada_test

vi sada_file.txt  --- made some changes to the files, to see if any changes reflected post push command

git add --all
above command push the chnages to the staging.
git commit -m "add meaningful commens for tracebility"
